# Tidy3D Client Revamp

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flexcompute/Tidy3D-client-revamp/HEAD?filepath=notebooks)

## Flow

### Client (Pre)

- Make `tidy3d.components` to define simulation.
	- Using builtin `tidy3d` imports (`td.PlaneWave`, `td.ModeMonitor`, etc.)
	- Using `tidy3d.plugins` to construct more specialized components (mode solver, dispersion fitter, etc.).
- Create a `td.Simulation` object containing all simulation parameters (pydantic will automaticall validate all components).
- Upload `Simulation` to server using `tidy3d.web`.
	- Export `Simulation` to a .json file format with `Simulation.json()`
	- Save as .json file.
	- Upload to server using http request, authenticate, etc.
	- Use `plugins.batch_processor` to submit batches of simulations.
- Manage task with `tidy3d.web`
	- Run task explicitly (if draft).
	- Monitor progress.
	- Cancel / delete task.

### Core

- Validate received .json file using `Simulation` schema file from our local copy of client.
- Load `.json` into `Simulation` object using local copy of client.
- Preprocess `Simulation` into files needed for core solver (need momchil's help).
- Run solver, export solver data files (need momchil's help).
- Postprocess solver data files into `SimulationData` containing `MonitorData` using definitions from local copy of client (need momchil's help).
- Export data file visualizations as .html to display on browser.
- Store data objects as .hdf5 files on server for download.

### Client (Post)

- Monitor solver progress, manage tasks.
- Load results into `SimulationData` and `MonitorData` objects locally.
	- Download .hdf5 files locally.
	- Open .hdf5 files as `SimulationData` and `MonitorData`.
- Visualize / post process results
	- data management using `xarray.DataArray` operations like `.sel()`, `.iterpolate()`.
	- simple plots with `MonitorData.plot()`
	- interactive plots with `MonitorData.visualize()` 
	- plugins for `near2far`, spectral analysis.

## Roadmap (113.5 days = 16.2 weeks = 3.7 months ~ jan 1)

### Component / API definition

- [x] Organize repo in basic structure we want moving forward (.5 days)
---
- [x] Decide on schema for all fields in tidy3d public (1 week)
	- [x] Simulation
	- [x] Geometry
	- [x] Medium
	- [x] MaterialLibrary
	- [x] Structure
	- [x] Source
	- [x] Monitor
	- [x] Mode
- [x] Write documentation explaining all components & design choices.
---
- [x] Write boilerplate for all plugins / packages (1 week)
	- [x] Dispersion fit (create `DispersiveMedium()` objects from nk data)
	- [x] Mode Solver (create specifications for waveguide modes using the solver)
	- [x] Batch Processor (submit and manage batches of jobs, used by below)
	- [x] Component Modeler (wrapper for analyzing S-matrix of device using ports)
	- [x] Device Optimizer (wrapper for parameter sweep / adjoint optimization routines)

### Web Emulation

- [x]  Write simple tidy3d_core
	- [x]  Preprocess simulation.json into Simulation
	- [x]  "solver" that generates fake data.
	- [x]  Postprocess solver data into tidy3d data objects.
- [ ]  Write emulated webAPI to transfer files back and forth (1 day)
	- [ ] Make `task` its own dataclass.
	- [ ] Create basic mock data creation.
