This repository provides a collection of examples and tutorials for the 
Tidy3D solver by Flexcompute Inc. Complete documentation can be found [here](http://simulation.cloud/docs/html/index.html).

## Note on imports

For correct imports, jupyter should be opened while in **root** directory of this repository.

This is where the tests are run from so the `sys.path.append('.')` calls are set up with that in mind.

Specifically, you should `$ jupyter lab .` when your working directory is `../` from this file.
